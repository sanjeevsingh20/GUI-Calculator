# Calculator GUI using Tkinter

## Overview

This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) calculator built using the Python library Tkinter. It provides basic arithmetic operations as well as additional functionalities including trigonometric and algebraic functions.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, tangent.
- Algebraic functions: square root, exponentiation, logarithm.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installation)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd calculator
```

3. Run the `calculator.py` file:

```bash
python calculator.py
```

## How to Use

1. Launch the application by running `calculator.py`.

2. The calculator GUI will appear. It consists of buttons for digits (0-9), arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), and various functions.

3. Click the buttons to input numbers and perform operations.

4. For trigonometric and algebraic functions, select the function from the appropriate buttons and then input the number you want to perform the operation on.

5. The result will be displayed in the entry field.

## Supported Operations

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- Trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, tangent.
- Algebraic functions: square root, exponentiation, logarithm.
